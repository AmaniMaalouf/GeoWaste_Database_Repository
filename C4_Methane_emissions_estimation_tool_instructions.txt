### How to use the C4_Methane_emissions_estimation_tool

This Python script calculates total methane (CH₄) emissions from waste decomposition based on input parameters. It is designed to be executed in a **Google Colab** environment and reads user-uploaded Excel files as input.

#### 1️⃣ Open in Google Colab  
This script is built for Google Colab. [Click here to open Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) and paste or upload the script.

#### 2️⃣ Prepare Your Input File  
Upload an Excel file (e.g., `inputs.xlsx`)
You will be prompted to upload this file when running the script.

#### 3️⃣ What the Script Does
- Calculates CH₄ emissions over a **100-year** simulation period using a first-order decay model.
- For each row in the input, the script computes:
  - Biodegradable waste
  - Methane generation per year
  - Cumulative methane emissions
- Outputs a new Excel file with an added column: `Total_CH4`.

#### ✅ Output File
After processing, an output Excel file (`output.xlsx`) will be automatically downloaded, containing:
- All original columns
- A new column: `Total_CH4` (total methane emissions in Gg per entry)
