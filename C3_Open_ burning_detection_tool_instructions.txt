##Overview

This Google Earth Engine (GEE) script detects and characterises open burning at municipal solid waste dumpsites using satellite-based active fire observations. The workflow integrates dumpsite polygon geometries with VIIRS active fire point detections to identify fire activity occurring at or near dumpsites.

##What the script does

- Loads dumpsite polygon geometries into Google Earth Engine
- Loads VIIRS active fire point collections for the period 2020–2024
- Converts VIIRS fire-confidence classes (L, N, H) to numeric scores
- Computes per-dumpsite fire statistics within a 100 m buffer, including:
	- Fire-detection counts
	- Mean confidence level
	- Annual and multi-year summaries
	- Visualises dumpsite polygons, buffers, and fire detections in the GEE map interface
- Exports a CSV file containing enriched dumpsite attributes to Google Drive

##Data availability

VIIRS active fire data are available from the NASA Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS):
https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/download/

##Data specifications

- Data source: VIIRS J1 (NOAA-20/JPSS-1), Collection 2

##Inputs

- Dumpsite polygons: User-uploaded shapefile stored as a GEE asset
- VIIRS active fire detections: Shapefile downloaded from FIRMS and uploaded to GEE

##Outputs

- Presence of open burning (yes/no)
- Fire-detection count
- Mean VIIRS confidence level
- Annual and multi-year fire statistics
- Outputs are exported as a CSV file to the user’s Google Drive.

##Instructions

- Upload dumpsite polygon shapefiles to Google Earth Engine
- Download VIIRS J1 active fire data from FIRMS and upload the shapefile to GEE
