OVERVIEW
This Google Earth Engine (GEE) script estimates the population speculated to be potentially affected
by municipal solid waste dumpsites for an indicative and arbitrary radius of 10 km and calculated using gridded population data.

WHAT THE SCRIPT DOES
- Loads dumpsite CSV datapoints in Google Earth Engine
- Loads the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) population raster
- Computes population counts within an indicative and arbitrary buffer around each dumpsite

DATA AVAILABILITY
- The dataset is available at:
  https://human-settlement.emergency.copernicus.eu/ghs_pop2023.php
- Direct download link:
